<!-- AND TAKE NOTICE THAT -->
<div class="section-header">AND TAKE NOTICE THAT:</div>

<div class="paragraph">(1) Before obtaining the foregoing grant or resealing, the applicant may be granted an authorization to obtain estate information or an authorization to obtain resealing information, as the case may be, in relation to that grant or resealing for the purposes of obtaining financial information in relation to the grant or resealing.</div>

<div class="paragraph">(2) You have a right to oppose, by filing a notice of dispute in accordance with Rule 25-10 (1),</div>
<div class="sub-paragraph">(a) if the intended application is for an estate grant, the granting of either or both of an authorization to obtain estate information and the estate grant, or</div>
<div class="sub-paragraph">(b) if the intended application is for a resealing, the granting of either or both of an authorization to obtain resealing information and the resealing.</div>

<div class="paragraph">(3) You may or may not be entitled to claim against the estate for relief, including a claim under</div>
<div class="sub-paragraph">(a) the Family Law Act, or</div>
<div class="sub-paragraph">(b) Division 6 of Part 4 of the Wills, Estates and Succession Act.</div>

<div class="paragraph">(4) If you choose to take a step referred to in paragraph (2) or (3), you must do so within the time limited by any relevant rule of court or other enactment.</div>

<div class="paragraph">(5) You may consult with your own lawyer concerning your interest in, or rights against, the estate.</div>

<div class="paragraph">(6) After the applicant has filed a submission for estate grant or submission for resealing, you may apply for an order requiring the applicant to provide security unless the applicant is the Public Guardian and Trustee. Filing a notice of dispute will prevent a grant from being issued before you are able to apply for the order requiring security.</div>

<div class="paragraph">(7) An authorization to obtain estate information, an authorization to obtain resealing information or a grant may issue to the applicant, or a foreign grant may be resealed, on any date that is at least 21 days after the date on which this notice is delivered to you or on any earlier date ordered by the court.</div>

<div class="paragraph">(8) If an authorization to obtain estate information issues to the applicant, the applicant may apply for a grant without further notice. If an authorization to obtain resealing information issues to the applicant, the applicant may apply for the resealing of the foreign grant without further notice to you.</div>

<div class="paragraph">(9) If a grant issues to the applicant, the applicant must provide, if there is a will, to the beneficiaries or, if there is no will, to intestate successors of the deceased, an accounting as to how the estate was administered and how the estate assets were distributed, and if a foreign grant is resealed as a result of the application, the intended applicant must provide, if there is a will, to the beneficiaries or, if there is no will, to intestate successors of the deceased, an accounting as to how the estate comprising the assets to which the resealed grant applies was administered and how those assets were distributed.</div>

<div class="note">[If this notice of proposed application is required to be delivered to the Public Guardian and Trustee under Rule 25-2, ensure all additional information required under Rule 25-2 (13) is provided to the Public Guardian and Trustee.]</div>

<div class="note">[A copy of the deceased's will, if any, identified above, must be delivered with this notice if the application is for a grant of probate or a grant of administration with will annexed. A copy of the foreign grant, and, if a copy of the will is not attached to the foreign grant, a copy of the will, must be delivered with this notice if the application is for a resealing of a foreign grant or for an ancillary grant of probate or an ancillary grant of administration with will annexed.
